# INST377-Final-Project

Title: WhatWeather

Description of your project:
Weather plays a critical role in our daily lives, influencing everything from what we wear to how we plan trips or events. However, many existing weather applications are either too cluttered with unnecessary features or lack the customization options users need to get the most relevant information quickly. This creates a gap for a clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing weather application that provides real-time data and forecasts in an intuitive way. “WhatWeather” aims to solve this problem by offering a dynamic web application that aggregates real-time weather data and presents it in an easy-to-understand format. The application will cater to a variety of stakeholders, including the general public, travelers, event planners, and farmers, all of whom rely on accurate weather information for decision-making. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, WhatWeather will provide current weather conditions, a 5-day forecast, and interactive weather maps, all in one place. The front end will be built using React.js for a responsive and interactive user interface, while Chart.js will be used to visualize weather trends, such as temperature fluctuations over time. Additionally, CSS/SCSS will be used to for mapping and modern formatting conventions. This solution will not only simplify access to weather data but also enhance the user experience through customizable features like saving favorite locations and setting weather alerts.

To bring WhatWeather to life, a combination of modern web technologies will be used to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience. On the front end, React.js will serve as the primary framework due to its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable UI elements and efficient state management. This will enable the creation of a dynamic and responsive interface that updates in real time as weather data changes. For data visualization, Chart.js will be integrated to display weather trends, such as temperature over time, in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. Additionally, Leaflet.js will be used to render interactive weather maps, providing users with a spatial understanding of weather patterns like precipitation and temperature. On the back end, Node.js with Express will handle server-side operations, including fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and serving it to the front end in a unified format. Axios will be used for making HTTP requests to the API, ensuring reliable data retrieval. To enhance user personalization, a MongoDB database will store user preferences, such as saved locations and custom alerts, with Mongoose facilitating schema-based data modeling and interaction. This combination of technologies ensures a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application that meets the needs of its stakeholders. For context, we will be using the free tiers of most of these services as we know that this project accounts for more academic services.
